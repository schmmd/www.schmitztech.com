### About

I am a software engineer, manager, and bowl turner in the Pacific Northwest.
I'm an alumnus of the [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu/)
and my current position is Director of Engineering at the [Allen Institute for AI](http://www.allenai.org).

Outside of work, I enjoy hiking in the Cascades, kayaking through the San
Juans, turning wooden bowls, and living the island life on Whidbey Island.
