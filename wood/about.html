        <p>
          After moving to  Whidbey Island, I extended my passion for foraging to
          wood. I don’t  fell trees for the wood, but rather I find them—across
          my driveway, fallen back in the forest, or removed for safety at a
          friend’s house—and do what I can to expose their beautiful grain in a
          useful product.  My goal is for people to treasure the beautiful
          tree long past its death.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of my wooden bowls were turned green, still wet with sap rather
          than dried for several months.  When the green wood dries it shrinks,
          causing the bowl to warp into an individually unique shape.  I finish
          most of my bowls without sanding for a rustic look that encourages use,
          but others I can't resist polishing until the grain pops.  I finish
          my bowls with walnut oil and beeswax that hardens to a durable
          food-safe finish.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can restore the finish with walnut oil at any time.  Simply apply
          walnut oil with your hands or a clean rag, let sit for 5 minutes,
          and wipe away the excess.  This is purely aesthetic as the new coat of
          oil only affects the outer surface rather than penetrating the wood
          which is already filled with hardened oil.  I prefer to let my bowls
          wear into a beautiful patina from regular use. Oatmeal with blueberries
          grinds a smooth surface with a pleasant purple color.
        </p>
        <p>
          To clean your bowl, just scrub it with soapy water and let it dry.
          I do not recommend putting your wooden bowl in the dishwasher or
          the microwave as the high heat may cause it to crack.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope your new bowl brings you many years of joy!
