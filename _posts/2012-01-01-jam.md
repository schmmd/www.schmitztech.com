Strawberry Jam
==============

June 2011
---------

* 4 c strawberries (mashed)
* 1/2 c honey
* 2 t pectin
* 2 t calcium solution

The jam jelled great with hardly any sugar! This is definately the low end of sugar for a jam. It ended up being more of a "fruit spread". I would probably try 1 c sugar next time.

July 2011
---------

* 4 c strawberries (mashed)
* 1 c sugar
* 2 t pectin
* 2 t calcium solution

Great set and perfect amount of sweetness.

Strawbarb Jam
=============

* 2 c strawberries (mashed)
* 2 c rhubarb (chopped and mashed)
* 3/2 c honey
* 3 t pectin
* 3 t calcium solution

Great flavor, perfect amount of sweetness, but it did not set well. I would try 4t pectin and 4t calcium solution next time.

Salmonberry Jam
===============

* 4 c salmonberries (mashed)
* 2 c sugar
* 2 t pectin
* 2 t calcium solution

I found this batch of salmonberries in Discovery Park, near the Daybreak Center. There are a million plants, but the berries are not always abundant.

Sweet but not overly so. I would not add more sugar; I might try using only 1.5 c sugar next time but the result is damn good. I rinsed the salmonberries and then left them in a colander to dry somewhat. They collected a bit of moisture however. I could have dried them better.

I first mashed them with a widely-spaced masher. The result was a somewhat mashed mixture with some whole berries.

The salmonberries did not fall apart when heated, so I mashed further with a pint glass bottom--and with good results.

The result was--delicious! A sweet, flavorful well-set jam. Not for those who don't like seeds, however!

Jalepeno Jam
============

First
-----

* 4 oz red jalepenos, cleaned (pith and seeds)
* 1 c apple cider vinegar
* 2 c sugar
* 1 tart apple (granny smith)
* 1 t lemon juice
* 2 red jalepenos
* 1.5 t pectin
* 2 t calcium

Blend the pectin with the sugar. Puree the jalepenos and apple in a food processor, using some of the vinegar as liquid. Chop the extra two jalepenos and add all ingredients (except calcium) to a saucepan Simmer for 5 minutes, add the calcium, and can.

This makes an excellent jam for spreading on toast--just the right amount of sweetness and spice. However, if you want more of a sauce to add to a salmon-and-cream-cheese sandwich, you might want to go with something spicier. I would probably increase the pectin if I were to do this over again

Second
------

* 6 oz red jalepenos
* 2 oz red bell pepper, cleaned (pith and seeds)
* 3/4 c apple cider vinegar
* 1 c sugar
* 2 small tart apple (Discovery park)
* 1 t lemon juice
* 2 red jalepenos, cleaned (pith)
* 2.5 t pectin
* 2.5 t calcium

Third
-----

* 6 oz red jalepenos
* 2 oz green jalapenos
* 3/4 c apple cider vinegar
* 1 c sugar
* 1 granny smith apple (8 oz)
* 1 t lemon juice
* 2.5 t pectin
* 2.5 t calcium

This jam was overset. I reduced pectin and calcium to 2t. Might reduce further.
