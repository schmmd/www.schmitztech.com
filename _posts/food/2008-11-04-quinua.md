Quinua is amazing. It contains all of your essential amino acids and a great
deal of protein. While it takes a little more effort than the similar
cous-cous, the wonderful aroma and sophisticated flavor make the extra fifteen
minutes worthwhile.

How can you eat quinua?

* You can make a tasty lunch by preparing a cup of quinua with a little butter and adding corn and some sriracha hot sauce.

* For a quinua feast, you can fry beef, onion (1/2 to 1), green onion (4), and bell pepper (1) and add it to a cup quinua for two servings. Using half red quinua and half white quinua will make your meal beautiful. Be sure to add some red pepper flakes, cayenne, and sriracha hot sauce.

* You can make a healthy breakfast by adding honey and blueberries to quinua.
How do you spell quinua? Some people write it "quinoa" but I prefer the
alternate spelling "quinua".
