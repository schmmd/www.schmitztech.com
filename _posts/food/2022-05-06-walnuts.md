## Walnuts

I'm obsessed with walnuts.  Why walnuts?  Well, I think they are the king of nuts.  I told my friend [Roy Schwartz](https://schwartz-lab-huji.github.io/) this and he responded, "Walnuts are not the king of nuts.  In Israel, walnuts are the cheapest nuts!"  I was sold, and booked my tickets to Israel soon thereafter.  During my trip, of course I learned that in Hebrew walnuts are literally called [the king's nut](https://www.balashon.com/2009/02/egoz.html).  Roy could not have been more wrong!

## What can you do with walnuts?

* Eat them, as they are delicious in both sweet and savory dishes.

* Build beautiful furniture out of walnut wood.  It's a native American species that has an exotic, tropical appearance.

* You can soak walnuts in alchohol [to create nocino](https://schmitztech.com/fermentation/nocino.html),
a dark black liquor with a earthy tannic walnut flavor and other spices.

## Black Walnuts

While English Walnuts are great, my true passion is for the black walnut--one
of the native walnuts of North America.  Ever since I stumbled across a mature
tree dropping its fruit in Everett, WA I've been fascinated with this special
nut.

I buy black walnuts in 5 lb boxes from [Hammons](https://black-walnuts.com/) so
I can eat black walnuts every day on my oatmeal.  I know they have more protein than any other nut,
and hope they are [as good for my brain](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/21/well/mind/dementia-prevention-food-diet.html)
as English walnuts even though the black walnuts does not resemble a brain.

Here are some fun facts about black walnuts:

* Black walnuts are among the hardest nuts to crack.  You can do it with a hammer and some railroad rail or you need a dedicated black walnut nut cracker, such as the [Grandpa's Goody Getter](https://www.grandpasgoodygetter.com/).  Many people (my father included) remember the struggle of cracking black walnuts in their youth for their parents.

* Black walnuts are foraged from the wild, because that's the easiest way to get them.  Presently most people eat very few wild foods, if any, as most have been highly domesticated.

* Black walnuts have [the highest protein of any nut](https://black-walnuts.com/learn-about-black-walnuts/health-and-nutrition/).

* Black walnut ice cream used to be a common flavor.  It was one of my grandmother's favorites.

## More evidence that I'm obsessed with walnuts

* My boat is the Salty Walnut.  Whenever it needs a wooden component, I try to source appropriate
black walnut lumber.

* I own 10 acres near Langley on Whidbey Island, where I've planted 8 walnut trees.  2 black walnut,
4 english walnut, and 2 butternut.  I can't wait until I can harvest my own walnuts, but the
squirrels may have other plans.

* Walnut is my favorite color.  Nothing beats a walnut dyed t-shirt.

* My idea of a work party is bringing in the Goody Getter and a bowl full of walnuts to crack.
People are immediately drawn the contraption and love the challenge of cracking a black walnut.

## Walnuts and your health

Walnuts are one of the best superfoods.  In fact, they make the inner wall of your colon glisten, a condition known as "walnut colon".  Learn more from Dr. John Birk in [this NY Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/27/well/eat/food-diet-cancer-risk.html).
