## Walnuts

I'm obsessed with walnuts.  Why walnuts?  Well, I think they are the king of nuts.  I told my friend [Roy Schwartz](https://schwartz-lab-huji.github.io/) this and he responded, "Walnuts are not the king of nuts.  In Israel, walnuts are the cheapest nuts!"  I was sold, and booked my tickets to Israel soon thereafter.  During my trip, of course I learned that in Hebrew walnuts are literally called [the king's nut](https://www.balashon.com/2009/02/egoz.html).  Roy could not have been more wrong!

## Black Walnuts

While English Walnuts are great, my true passion is for the black walnut--one
of the native walnuts of North America.  Ever since I stumbled across a mature
tree dropping its fruit in Everett, WA I've been fascinated with this special
nut.  Here are some fun facts about black walnuts:

* Black walnuts are among the hardest nuts to crack.  You can do it with a hammer and some railroad rail or you need a dedicated black walnut nut cracker, such as the [Grandpa's Goody Getter](https://www.grandpasgoodygetter.com/).  Many people (my father included) remember the struggle of cracking black walnuts in their youth for their parents.

* Black walnuts are foraged from the wild, because that's the easiest way to get them.  Presently most people eat very few wild foods, if any, as most have been highly domesticated.

* Black walnuts have [the highest protein of any nut](https://black-walnuts.com/learn-about-black-walnuts/health-and-nutrition/).

* Black walnut ice cream used to be a common flavor.  It was one of my grandmother's favorites.

## Fuck Pecans

Pecans are the nut of the south.  I don't understand why people up north would eat pecans instead of walnuts.  It just doesn't make sense!

1.  [Walnuts improve cognitive function.](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/21/well/mind/dementia-prevention-food-diet.html), frequently listed as a top brain food.  Do pecans make the list?  No!

2.  People like pecan pies.  Well, have they ever tried a walnut pie?  They are delicious.  For even better, try a black walnut pie.
