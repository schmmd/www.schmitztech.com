Fish and chips are amazing, but it helps to know the right place when you have
a craving.

## Very Special

* Sea Js, Port Townsend.  Best fish and chips in Washington, but you might skip
  on the coffee.  Crispy yet moist, and served with not only coleslaw but
  buttered toast! "The only place for fish and chips."

* Lockspot, Seattle.  A favorite place to eat fish and chips on a dark and
  stormy Tuesday night, before a late night walk through the pitch dark in
  Discovery Park.  Plus they have a happy hour special on Tuesday before 7!

* Pacific Inn, Seattle.  Delicious breaded fish and chips. The hobo on the sign recommends them too!

* The Big W, Bayview.  A large fish fillet with excellent fries

* Dockside Fish Market, Grand Marais.  Catch of the day cooked up fresh.  If you bring your own wooden bowl they will fill it up instead of giving you styrofoam to go.

* Blackbird (Shoreline).  Exquisite fish with way many small tasty fries.
  The coleslaw was fresh and delicious, without tasting too healthy.

## Dependably Good

* Ivars, Mukilteo.  Waiting for a ferry?  Well you might as well chow down on
  some fish and chips from Ivars, which is always dependably delicious.  Plus
  they have soft serve that takes me back to my childhood.

* Mondo, Marblemount.  Coming back from a backpacking trip in the north
  cascades?  Why not stop at Mondo for some great fish and chips.  They come
  with a large serving of fresh coleslaw.

## I don't need them again

* Chinooks, Seattle.  They have a fish window, but the fish and chips were
  disappointing.
