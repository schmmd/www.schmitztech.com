Mix:

* 4 c rolled oats (or 2 c oats and 2 c barley)
* 1 c pecans
* 1 c dried currants
* 1 c sunflower seeds
* 1 c wheat germ

In a 1 quart Pyrex, mix:

* 3/4 c honey
* 1/4 c dark maple syrup
* 1/4 c walnut oil
* 1 T cinnamon
* (1 tsp salt)

Microwave liquid ingredients on high for 1 minute. Mix with the dry
ingredients, spread thinly on a baking sheet, and bake at 350 F for 35 to 40
minutes. Mix the granola after 20 minutes. If you want it more roasted, you can
turn the temperature up for the last ten minutes to 375, but keep a sharp eye
on the granola and stir it often.
