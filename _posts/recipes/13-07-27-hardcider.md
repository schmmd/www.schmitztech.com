In 2012 I built a cedar cider press for pressing the copious wild apples in
Roslyn into cider. For the most part, I followed Herrick Kimball's design.
However, I had a number of modifications.

Press
-----

The press is made of reclaimed cedar (old deck) and finished with shellac. The
tub is finished with pure Tung oil.

Disks
-------

The disks are made out of two cherry boards glued together and then routered
out. These are somewhat weak and I wish I had food-grade plastic disks that fit
my press.

The next year I made disks out of a solid piece of oak.  They are much
stronger, but still the grain needs t o be oriented opposite the pressing block
to avoid splitting the disks.

Tub
---

The tub is made of cherry slats with a brass ring.

My design had a brass capping piece that bridged that joined the brass band
ends. This was very difficult. Next time, I would go with the simpler design of
having a single brass ring that overlaps. It's relatively thin metal so the
double-thick portion of the band would be hardly noticeable.

I riveted the slats to the bands.

I wish dearly I had countersunk the rivets on the inside so that pressing disks would never get caught on the rivets. I used brass bolts to connect the two bands so the bands could be disassembled.

Pressing Plate
This is the disk at the top of the press that distributes the upward force to the press itself. I initially purchased a small 4x4 plate.

This was insufficient. We ended up putting a piece of tool steel to press against. This was a pain because it wasn't fixed. Also, the plate was too small and it was easy to press the jack against the screws instead of the plate itself. My new piece (should be) much better.
