### Dutch Oven Recipe

Feeds five, easily!  The recipe was adapted from "The Dutch Oven Cookbook:
Recipes for the Best Pot in Your Kitchen" by Sharon Kramis and Julie
Kramis-Hearne to build an at-home version of the backcountry recipe.

* 3 T butter
* 1 large diced yellow onion
* 1 c finely chopped celery.
* 3 T flour
* 1 q chicken stock (low sodium)
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 1/2 c red quinua
* 1 lb corn
* 3-5 stalks green onion
* 1 c heavy cream
* 1 1/4 lb salmon
* salt, pepper, dill (to taste)

Melt butter in dutch oven.  Add vegetables (onion, celery) and cook 5 minutes.
Sprinkle flour over vegetables and mix well.  Slowly add broth and simmer 5
minutes.  Add potatoes, quinua, and bay leaf.  Cook over low heat until the
potatoes are tender (about 15 minutes).  Add corn, green onion, salmon, and
cream.  Simmer 8 minutes more, or until done.


### Backcountry Recipe

Feeds two, while camping!

* 1.5 c quinua
* 1/2 onion
* 1/2 to 1 c corn chowder
* salmon
* salt, pepper, butter
* > 3 cups water

Cook quinua in a little more than three cups water.  If at any stage the meal
looks dry, add more water.  When the quinua has five minutes left, add the
onion, the corn chowder, and the butter.  When the quinua is done, add the
remaining ingredients.
