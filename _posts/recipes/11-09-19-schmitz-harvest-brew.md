* 6.6 lbs light liquid malt
* 2 lbs light dry malt
* 8 oz 40 L barley grain
* 1.5 oz [http://www.brewwiki.com/index.php/Warrior_Hops Warrior] 12.5% alpha bittering hops (60 minutes from end of boil; at the start)
* 4 oz wet, 3 oz dry [http://brewwiki.com/index.php/Cascade_Hops Cascade hops] (20 minutes from end of boil)
* 4 oz wet, 3 oz dry [http://brewwiki.com/index.php/Cascade_Hops Cascade hops] (0 minutes from the end of boil)

We harvested the hops on the 5th of September, racked on the 9th, and bottled with 2/3 c cane sugar on the 20th. The resulting beer was malty and thick--with a pleasant hop taste that was not overly bitter. Similar to the Hale's October beer. Potentially similar (I tried this beer a year after the homebrew) to the Hopped Red beer from the Green Flash Brewery, San Diego.


2009
----

* 1 pkg [http://www.wyeastlab.com/rw_styledetails.cfm?ID=168 Wyeast American IPA]
* 6.6 lbs light liquid malt
* 2 lb light dry malt
* 8 oz 40 L barley grain
* 1.5 oz Columbus 12.6 % alpha bittering hops (60 minutes from end of boil; at the start)
* 20 oz wet Cascade hops (20 minutes from end of boil)
* 10 oz wet Cascade hops (5 minutes from end of boil)
* 10 oz wet Cascade hops (0 minutes from end of boil)
* 1 more handful of wet hops for good measure

Group thoughts: the resulting beer was a crisp, clear beer with a strong flora (hop) taste. It was refreshing, though not too complex. A few people commented that it would make an excellent summer beer. It had good carbonation.

Michael's thoughts: the beer was a beautiful golden-amber that was also quite clear but still had some depth of color. While pouring, there is a strong floral hop smell. However, the beer was slightly over-bittered, which made the delicious wet hop flavors too subtle. It also was a bit over-carbonated. I need to aim for more hop flavor, more malty body, and a little less carbonation.

Early 2010 Prototype
--------------------

### IRA A
Barley:

* 6.5 lb pale ale malt (2 row)
* 5.0 lb Munich malt
* 0.75 lb medium crystal malt (60 L)
* 0.5 lb dark crystal malt (120 L)
* 2.0 oz black patent malt

Hops:

* 60m: 1.5 oz Amarillo
* 20m: 2 oz Cascade
* 05m: 2 oz Cascade
* 00m: 1.5 oz Cascade
* dry: 0.5 oz Cascade

Batch sparged, with around 5 gallons of water total including the lauter.

Tasting notes: the body was lacking some substance because of the low efficiency we had in the mash. Very pleasant hopiness.

### IRA B
Barley:

* 6.5 lb pale ale malt (2 row)
* 5.0 lb Munich malt
* 0.75 lb medium crystal malt (60 L)
* 0.5 lb dark crystal malt (120 L)
* 2.0 oz chocolate malt (instead of Black Patent)

Hops:

* 60m: 2 oz Amarillo
* 20m: 2 oz Cascade
* 00m: 1 oz Cascade
* dry: 0.5 oz Cascade

Tasting notes: EXCELLENT! Pleasant Cascade aroma, thick malty taste w/out being
overly sweet. High balanced hopiness. Fruity 1332 (NWPA yeast) taste. After
aging, however, I sometimes found the beer overly bitter. Maybe less Amarillo?
1 oz?

### 2010

I would like to try a different yeast. Maybe [http://www.wyeastlab.com/hb_yeaststrain_detail.cfm?ID=139 Wyeast 1332] or [http://www.wyeastlab.com/hb_yeaststrain_detail.cfm?ID=11 Wyeast 1272].
