Yield: 4 portions

Ingredients
* 4 ounces (about 2 cups) cavatappi pasta, uncooked
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 pound assorted mushrooms (such as Portabella, crimini, shiitake and oyster), cut into 1/2-inch pieces
* 4 tablespoons butter
* 4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 2 cups milk
* 6 ounces fresh goat cheese
* 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
* 2 tablespoons fresh rosemary, minced
* 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves

## Directions

Preheat oven to 350Â° F. Cook pasta according to package directions.

While pasta cooks, heat olive oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high
heat. Add a single layer of mushrooms and cook, without stirring, for about 5
minutes or until mushrooms become red-brown on one side. Flip mushrooms and
cook about 5 minutes more, until other side is same color.

Melt butter in a large saucepan and stir in flour. Cook for a minute or two to
slightly toast flour. Stir in salt and whisk in milk. Bring to a low boil over
medium-high heat, stirring occasionally to slightly thicken sauce, for about
five minutes. Remove sauce from heat, whisk in cheeses, rosemary and thyme and
stir to melt. Stir in mushrooms and pasta and divide between four one-cup
ramekins.

Place ramekins on baking sheet and bake until cheese bubbles around edges,
about 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from oven and let rest for about five minutes.
Serve warm.
