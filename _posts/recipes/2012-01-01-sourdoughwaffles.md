This is a recipe from my grandmother, who grew up in Oregon.

* 2 c flour
* 2 c warm water
* 1/2 c sourdough starter
* 2 level Tbs sugar
* 1/2 tsp baking powder
* 5 Tbs oil
* 3 eggs
* 1/2 tsp baking soda (dissolved in 1 Tbs water)

Add flour and water to starter. Beat until smooth and let stand, covered, in a
warm place overnight. In the morning, add all ingredients to the batter. Then
gently fold in dissolved baking soda. Cook in waffle iron.
