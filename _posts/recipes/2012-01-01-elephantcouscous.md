Recipe from Sara Owens.

Fry 2 cups cous-cous in 3 Tbs oil until browned. Then add a little more than 2
cups of water/vegetable broth and cook until the cous-cous is done. Mix in warm
veggie burger and peas, corn, and/or any other vegetable available (fried
onions would taste good). Add 2 Tbs tomato paste and marjoram, basil, garlic,
cayenne, salt, and pepper to taste. Top with parmesan cheese.
