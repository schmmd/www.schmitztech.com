Macaroni and Cheese (microwave recipe) from Maureen Schmitz.

* 1 lb of uncooked macaroni noodles
* 4 TBS butter
* 4 TBS flour
* 1 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/8 tsp pepper
* 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
* 1 tsp prepared mustard
* 2 c milk
* 4 c shredded cheddar cheese

Prepare noodles. Drain. Place in a large bowl. Set aside. Place butter in a 1
quart bowl or larger. Microwave on high for 1 1/4 min, until butter melts. Stir
in flour, salt, pepper, Worcestershire, mustard. Blend in milk. Microwave for
4-6 min or until thickened, stirring 2 times. Add cheese, stirring until cheese
melts. Mix into cooked macaroni. Microwave for 5 min. or bake a little longer
than that. You may want to cover it if you don't want the top crispy.

Also microwave times can vary.
