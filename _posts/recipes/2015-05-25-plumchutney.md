## Pulled Pork

### Ingredients

* 1/4 cup packed light-brown sugar
* 1/2 to 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
* Coarse salt and ground pepper
* 3 pounds boneless pork shoulder (Boston butt), cut into 4 equal pieces
* 1 1/2 cups cider vinegar

1. In a small bowl, combine sugar, cayenne, 1 tablespoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper.
1. Place pork in a 5-quart Dutch oven and rub with the spice mixture.
1. In a medium bowl, combine vinegar, garlic, plum chutney, and 1/2 cup water; pour over pork. Cover pot, and place in oven on lower rack. Bake until pork is very tender and separates easily when pulled with a fork, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.
1. Transfer pork to a work surface, reserving pan juices. With two forks, shred meat. Transfer to a large bowl, and toss with pan juices to moisten.
