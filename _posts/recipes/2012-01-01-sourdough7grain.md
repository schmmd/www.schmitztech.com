Combine:

* 1 c bread flour
* 1/2 c whole wheat flour
* 1/4 c 7-grain cereal
* 1 c water
* 1 T starter

Mix well. Let stand 24 hours in a warm place. Add:

* 1 c flour
* 1 t salt
* 1 T brown sugar (for darker crust)
* (sea salt flakes)

Knead 15-30 minutes, adding flour as necessary. Let rise until doubled in volume. This will take an hour to three hours depending on the temperature you rise it at. The warmer the loaf the faster the rise. Optionally punch the loaf down, then knead it lightly and allow for a second rise. This rise will happen much faster, so check your loaf often, especially if it is in a warm. You may want to perform this second rise directly on the baking surface or upside down in a bread basket if you are baking on a bread stone. Optionally add sea salt flakes to the loaf's exterior. Preheat oven to 500 degrees. Score and insert the bread. Immediately reduce the temperature to 425 and bake for 40-50 minutes or until done. Cool on a rack or towel.

Alternatively, you can bake the loaf in a dutch oven. This allows the moisture in the bread to circulate. Place the loaf in the dutch oven for the second rise. Bake with the lid on in an oven preheated to 425 for 30 minutes. Then reduce the heat to 375 and bake for 15-20 more minutes or until beautifully browned. Cool on a rack or towel.
