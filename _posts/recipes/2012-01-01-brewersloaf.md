It's surprisingly difficult to make wonderful bread from spent grain. Despite
its wonderful scent, adding spent grain to bread early causes a sharply acidic
smell with strong biological odors (similar to a light vomit). Surprisingly,
the malodor seems to dissipate with time as the loaf loses moisture and the
bread recovers a full and sweet malty smell. However breads fermented with the
barley end up gummy and have a strange crust that is gluey in appearance. The
wet grains also retain a very high amount of moisture, and the baker needs to
be careful because outside of the loaf might look done but the interior may
have too much moisture and an underbaked interior due to the moisture retained
by the soaked grains.

Adding dried grains avoids these problems. The loaf comes out with a pleasant
sourdough smell and a beautifully browned crust.

I have also found that chopping the grains can help with the bread's texture
and structure, as some of the grains are quite large and a large amount of them
can be overwhelming.
