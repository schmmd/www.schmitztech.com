Although they do not actually contain llama, Llama Cookies are absolutely
delicious! They are also excellent for backpacking, as they are high in
calories and nutrition (at least, for a cookie). This recipe is from Sara
Owens.

* 1 1/4 c butter
* 2 cups raw sugar
* 5 eggs
* 1 Tbsp vanilla
* 2 tsp salt
* 2 tsp baking soda
* 3 1/4 c whole wheat flour
* 2 1/4 c wheat germ
* 4 1/4 quick oats

1 package chocolate chips (the original recipe calls for raisins but chocolate
is more tasty) Mix ingredients in that order. Bake at 350 for 11 min. Makes 100
cookies. You can freeze them.
