I want to share my new favorite recipe for baking with honey. https://smittenkitchen.com/2018/12/baklava-babka/

The author calls it Baklava Babka and I describe it as a honey and nut swirl
loaf. Most "honey" bread-type recipes either use a laughably small quantity of
honey or overcook it so it looses all its fresh flavor (and, I assume loses
vitamins, enzymes, etc). This one uses 3/4 cup and pours it on the loaf to soak
after baking. I recommend adding less water to the honey drizzle and not
boiling it. I mix 3/4 cup honey with 1/4 cup water and warm it just enough to
blend it into an even syrup consistency. While baking, mine needs a foil cover
and about 30 minutes additional oven time to cook evenly. The finished loaf
keeps well for a few days at room temperature and can be frozen. Enjoy!

For the nuts, I use a combination of walnuts and pistachios.
