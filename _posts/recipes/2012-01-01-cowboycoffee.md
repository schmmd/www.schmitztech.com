## Recipe

Adapted from: http://www.ineedcoffee.com/04/cowboycoffee/

* 1/4 c ground coffee beans (auto drip grind)
* 1 pt water

Bring the water to a boil and add the grounds. Return the water to a boil. This
should happen nearly immediately and the ground may cause the water level to
rise. If a boilover is imminent, remove from heat, stir the grounds, and use a
larger pot next time. Boil just long enough to wet the grounds. Optionally stir
the surface to ensure that all the grounds are wet. Remove from heat, put the
lid on, and let sit in a warm place for five minutes. Pour carefully to avoid
shaking up the settled grounds. Do not pour the grounds at the bottom.

You should not feel any grounds in your mouth while drinking the coffee. But
don't drink every last drop or you will end up with a mouthful of grounds!

For an entire breakfast in a pot, boil eggs in the water for two minutes before
adding the grounds. Rinse the eggs after you serve the coffee. Now you can
enjoy coffee and soft boiled eggs!

## Comments

Using a coarse grind may seem intuitive because cowboy coffee is essentially
unfiltered french press. However, in my experience, coarser grounds tend to
float, creating an extremely unpleasant brew. The drip grinds seem to be a good
balance.

There are many reports of throwing in an eggshell or a whole shelled egg into
the coffee to remove the grounds. Although I thought it helped once, I don't
think the eggshell helps. I think people throw in an eggshell because they
misunderstood that they were supposed to throw in a whole egg. I've never
thrown in a whole egg. It probably collects a lot of the grounds, but it wastes
an egg and I don't have a problem with grounds anyways. I'd be happy to hear
about other people's experiences with eggs though!

## Earlier Experiments

### Espresso Grind

#### Recipe

Adapted from: http://www.ineedcoffee.com/04/cowboycoffee/

* 1/3 c espresso ground beans
* 1 pt water

Bring the water to a boil and add the grounds. Bring the water back to a boil.
In my experience, this happens nearly immediately. Continue boiling (you may
need to move the pot around to boil strategically) until all of the grounds are
wet, but not more than a minute or the drink will become too bitter. Remove
from heat, put the lid on, and insulate for five minutes. Pour carefully.

#### Review

This ended up being more of a Turkish style brew. However, the grounds did not
settle very well. Some remained floating on top and transferred to my cup. The
first sip was rather grainy--but not too unpleasant. The coffee tasted
delicious with limited bitterness. There were a lot of leftover grounds in my
cup at the end.

### Coarse Grind

#### Recipe

 * 1/3 c coarse (french press) ground beans
 * 1 pt water
 * 1 egg shell
 * Bring the water to a boil. Add the grounds and the eggshell and return to a boil. Some sources mention that adding the grounds will calm the boil, but I found the addition makes the boil many times more vigorous. Maybe other people add freezing cold beans? I boiled until all of the grounds where wetted and then removed from the heat, put the lid on, and let sit for 4 minutes. Before serving I splashed some wet water into the coffee to help it settle. In the future I would use milk.

#### Review

The coffee tasted more bitter than the espresso grind, but still tasty. The coffee had no graininess--it was much like a French press coffee. When I first opened the lid, there were a lot of grounds on top, but then I put the lid back and opened it again some seconds later and the grounds had settled. I don't know how the eggshell does it, but I think it definitely helps as I tried to make cowboy coffee without it once and ended up with a lot of floaties. It especially helps with the finer grounds that have difficulty settling out otherwise.

#### Afterthoughts

If your grounds are too coarse, you can get floaties. Large chunks of coffee beans tend to float. The egg shell makes a lot of small bubbles on the top of the coffee (a product of the egg white), but does an excellent job of settling out the finer coffee particles. I tried coarse grounds, and then moved to percolator grounds. I'm interested in trying drip ground and espresso ground with the egg shell.

### Terrible Experiment

If you put the grounds in when the water is cold, the resulting brew will be very bitter and flavorless.
