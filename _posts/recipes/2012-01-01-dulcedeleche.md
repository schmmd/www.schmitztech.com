This recipe is from my Argentine host mother, Carmen Murphy.

 * 3 L milk
 * 800 g sugar (about [http://www.gourmetsleuth.com/gram_calc.htm 4 c])
 * 1 T baking soda

Bring milk and sugar to a boil.  When it just begins to boil, add 1 T baking
osda.  When the milk rises (it will try to boil over), lift the pot from the
burner until the milk falls again.  Repeat until the milk stops rising.  Cook
until done.  To test for thickness, place some dulce de leche on a plate and
wave it in the air so that it cools.  Watch how fast it slides down the plate.
