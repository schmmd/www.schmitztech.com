Kinda like granola but with more nuts.

Mix:

* 1 c walnuts
* 1/2 c oats
* 1/2 c black walnuts
* 1/2 c almonds
* 1/2 c flaxseed meal
* 1/2 c pumpkin seeds
* 1/2 c macadamia nuts
* 1/2 c sunflower seads

In a 1 quart Pyrex, mix:

* 3/4 c honey
* 1/4 c dark maple syrup
* 1/4 c walnut oil
* (1 tsp salt)

Microwave liquid ingredients on high for 1 minute. Mix with the dry
ingredients, spread thinly on a baking sheet, and bake at 350 F until done (less than 40 minutes).
You will need to mix the granola at least once.
