These are called "Joy Beans" because the recipe is adapted from a recipe in the 1973 "Joy of Cooking".

Soak then drain

1 lb. navy/white beans
Just cover with water in a saucepan that has a lid. Add:

* 3 T butter
* 1 c chopped onion (about)
* 5 whole cloves
* 2 t salt
* 1/2 t ground pepper
* 1/4 t thyme

Simmer covered for 1 to 1.5 hours. Stir from time to time. Add:

* 1 c dry red wine
* 1 T balsamic vinegar
* (dried broth)

And simmer 20 minutes longer (until there is an appropriate amount of moisture in the beans). Garnish with parsley.
