# Wedding Soap

# Walnut Castile Soap

I had to find a use for some excess walnut oil so I made some soap.

* 90 oz walnut oil (La Tourangelle)
* 11.12 oz lye
* 0.82 oz KOH
* 30 oz water
* 1 tablespoonh salt
* 1/2 tsp walnut dye

Dissolve salt in the water and then add the lye and KOH.  One stirred and
dissolved, mix in the dye and cool to 150F.  Meanwhile heat the oil to 160F.
When both solution are at temperature add the lye to the oil and stir until
cream, homogeneous, and traced (we used a stick blender to speed up the
process).

Next time we might use 1 tsp dye.

# Beeswax Olive Soap (Wedding Soap)

* 26 oz olive oil
* 4 oz beeswax
* 2 oz palm oil
* 4.2 oz lye
* 16 oz water
