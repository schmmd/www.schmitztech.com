On Whidbey we have a huge Shiro plum tree.  It produced around 15 gallons of
plums this year.  We make plum chutney with many of the plums, but that's not
nearly enough.  This year we tried a couple of plum wine recipes.

## First Recipe

We made a triple batched (all ingredients multipled by 3).

* 8 lb plums, pitted
* 3 pints water
* 1 lb sugar
* 1/2 t acid blend
* 1 t pectic enzyme
* 1 t yeast nutrient
* 1 campden tablet
* 1 package wine yeast

## Second Recipe

We tried a recipe with no added water.

* 15 pints of plums (with 6 red plums)
* 1 lb sugar
* 1/2 t acid blend
* 1 1/2 t pectic enzyme
* 1 t yeat nutrient
* 2 campden tablets
* 1 package wine yeat

# 2016 Plum Wine

Our previous plum wine was delicious, but quite tart--particularly in the
aftertaste.  Because of this, we added more sugar, which should increase
the alcohol to the maximum (~ 14%) and the sweetness slightly.

* 1 gallon crushed plums (pits too)
* 2 lb sugar
* 1/2 tsp acid blend
* 1 1/2 tsp pctic enzyme
* 1 tsp yeast nutrient
* 2 camden tablets
* 1 package yeast (Cote des Blancs)
