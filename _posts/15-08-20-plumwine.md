# 2016 Plum Wine

Our previous plum wine was delicious, but quite tart--particularly in the
aftertaste.  Because of this, we added more sugar, which should increase
the alcohol to the maximum (~ 14%) and the sweetness slightly.

* 1 gallon crushed plums (pits too)
* 2 lb sugar
* 1/2 tsp acid blend
* 1 1/2 tsp pectic enzyme
* 1 tsp yeast nutrient
* 2 camden tablets
* 1 package yeast (Cote des Blancs)

Tasting notes: the plum wine still has a tart aftertase, but also a pleasant
sweetness--much more akin to what you would expect from a plum wine but without
restricting itself to a desert wine.  While we're not smitten, we have
confidence it will age well.  Sara is a huge fan--it reminds her of her
childhood.

# 2015

On Whidbey we have a huge Shiro plum tree.  It produced around 15 gallons of
plums this year.  We make plum chutney with many of the plums, but that's not
nearly enough.  This year we tried a couple of plum wine recipes.


## First Recipe

We made a triple batched (all ingredients multiplied by 3).

* 8 lb plums, pitted
* 3 pints water
* 1 lb sugar
* 1/2 t acid blend
* 1 t pectic enzyme
* 1 t yeast nutrient
* 1 campden tablet
* 1 package wine yeast

## Second Recipe

We tried a recipe with no added water.

* 15 pints of plums (with 6 red plums)
* 1 lb sugar
* 1/2 t acid blend
* 1 1/2 t pectic enzyme
* 1 t yeast nutrient
* 2 campden tablets
* 1 package wine yeast
