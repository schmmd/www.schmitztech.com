## 2022 Nocino

* 2 lb black walnuts
* 2 c cinnamon sticks
* zest of 1 lemon
* 1 L vodka
* 5 whole cloves
* 1 star anise
* 0.1 oz angelica
* 2/3 vanilla

The black walnut nocino is a bit more astringent, but has a delicious,
intriguing, and exotic flavor.  The English walnut is a bit smoother, but I think I prefer the intrigue of the black walnut!

## 2021 Nocino

* 2 lb green walnuts, quartered
* 2 cinnamon sticks
* 1/2 vanilla bean
* zest of 1 lemon
* 200 ml everclear (95%)
* 800 ml vodka (40%)
* 5 whole cloves
* 2 allspice berries
* 1 star anise
* 1 oz dried angelica root (only to 1 batch)

We reduced the sugar to 300g and it was plenty sweet.  The angelica had a very potent odor and we were worried, but the taste was pleasant, particularly when the two were blended.  For the next batch, I would consider 1/4 oz angelica per liter of alcohol.
