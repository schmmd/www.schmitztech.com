## 2021 Nocino

* 2 lb green walnuts, quartered
* 2 cinnamon sticks
* 1/2 vanilla bean
* zest of 1 lemon
* 200 ml everclear (95%)
* 800 ml vodka (40%)
* 5 whole cloves
* 2 allspice berries
* 1 star anise
* 1 oz dried angelica root (only to 1 batch)

We reduced the sugar to 300g and it was plenty sweet.  The angelica had a very potent odor and we were worried, but the taste was pleasant, particularly when the two were blended.  For the next batch, I would consider 1/4 oz angelica per liter of alcohol.
