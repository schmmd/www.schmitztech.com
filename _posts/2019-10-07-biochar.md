# Biochar

Biochar is charcoal made sustainably from waste wood.  It sequesters carbon in
the soal and prevents nutrients from being slowly leached.  Biochar is
typically charged with fertilizer before being applied to a garden, where the
nutrients are slowly released.

A good friend of mine makes biochar in batches using [a biochar
barrel](http://www.holon.se/folke/carbon/simplechar/simplechar.shtml).  He'll
often use wood cutoffs from construction projects (eg. untreated fir 2x4).  I
typically burn these for heat in my wood stove, but I have a large amount of
brush from fallen trees that needs disposal.

To turn this brush into bulk biochar I first dug a 4' hole.  I chose this size
to comply with the maximum burn pile that doesn't need a permit.  We cut the
brush into pieces and fed it over several hours and it burned extremely clean.
Eventually the wood filled the hole with charcoal.  Only the surface wood
turns to ash, which is not desirable.  The rest stays charcoal because it
doesn't get any oxygen.

Afterwards we covered the pit with soil and watered a bit, but a week later
when I dug it up it re-ignited.  Next time I would use a lot more water to
put out the coals.

Once the coals cooled we dug them up and moved them to a concrete slab.
Overall we had about 1/3 of a yard of charcoal.  We sifted the charcoal to
separate out the fine product, since it's better than fertilizer.  Large pieces
will absorb nutrients without making it available to plants.

The rest we spread out and crushed by driving over it, which was incredibly
effective.
