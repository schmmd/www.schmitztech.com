## Wooden Crates

![Wooden Create]({{ baseurl }}/assets/img/woodencrate.jpg)

I recently build a couple of building with board and batten siding and needed
to find a project in which to use the offcuts.  A perfect project is wooden
crates, which can make use of an offcut only 12" long.

Having made quite a few wooden crates, I prefer crates that are 12" by 20".  Of
course, the actual dimensions can vary a bit depending on their use and the
materials, but this is a good size that feels comfortable in my hands.
Typically I use 12x or 10x material that's planed to around 5/8" thick.

The crates fit together with 1/2" finger joints and have a rabbet for a bottom
board.  The bottom board can either be a solid 12x board that's 1/2" thick, or
fine 1/4" plywood such as ApplyPly or EuroPly.  The plywood is expensive (over
$100), but a single sheet can make 20 crates ($5-6 per crate).

A critical part is the handle, which I cut out of each end.  I form a 4.5" slot
centered 2" down by first drilling two 1 1/8" holes.  I next use a router bit
to join the holes into a slot.  And then a roundover router bit to give the
handles a radiused edge.

Since the materials are construction offcuts, they typically have a fair amount
of cupping to them, so for the glue-up I need to use a lot of clamps to get
everything nice and tight together.  Ideally my joints fit tightly together by
hand without pounding, but if they are too tight, then I can use hide glue so
they slide together.
