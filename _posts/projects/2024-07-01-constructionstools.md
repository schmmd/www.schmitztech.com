## Construction  Stools

![Construction Stools](/assets/img/construction-stools.jpg)

Our house build had quite a few 2x12" rafter offcuts and I wanted to find a use
for them.  I ended up making some "construction stools"--small stools made
entirely of construction offcuts.  To keep the design simple, I made them 11" x
22" with a 24 degree splay.

I bored 1" mortises and cut a 2.5" tenon on each leg.  The legs were initially
cut to 14" so the stool would be about 12" high after leveling. I shaped them
as octogons with a drawknife and shaped a tenon on the lathe.  Assembly is
simply knocking the legs in and wedging them.  I used white glue rather than
hide glue because they might sit out in the weather.

I've only had these stools a few months, but they've proven quite handy.  They
are lightweight and, so far, quite durable.  We will see how they survive the
winter.
