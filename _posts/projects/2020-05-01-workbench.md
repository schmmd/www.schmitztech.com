I decided that I finally needed a workbench, and settled on a Roubo design.
Finding the appropriate lumber gave me a slow start, as neithter my local sawmill nor the largest
lumberyard in the area carries anything in 5" thicknesses.  In addition, this summer saw the
highest lumber prices ever, making it unreasonable to laminate a workbench out of construction
lumber.

After contenting myself to build my bench out of material I wasn't too excited about, I found the
perfect collection of 5.5" x 13" oak slabs at [Second Use](https://www.seconduse.com/).  They were
the perfect size and in good condition, with little visible defects.  Apparently they were millitary
dunnage that was stored in a covered barn for 20 years, and then stored indoors for a year after
that--so they were as dry as could be expected for something 5" thick.  Soon for $600 I had them
loaded in my Subaru, which was packed to the gills.  The fuel filter burst apart on my way home,
which I think was unrelated, but might have had to do with my 500 lb load.

Back in the shop, my first item was to plane the beams so they were planar and square.  A 12"
jointer would have been nice, but moving these beams was exhausting so I decided to true them up
with a jack plane.

Soon I learned that there was a fair amount of twist, and I that I needed to remove up to 1/2" from
these beams with a handplane, which is a lot of work!  Winding sticks were super helpful, but I
also realied heavily on my 3' straightedge.  I would detect twist by putting it over a particular
spot angled in both directions.  If one direction it rocked but the other it looked cupped, then
the board was twisted at that point.  I made a 7' straightedge with my jointer which I needed to
make sure my board didn't curve over it's length.  It was easy to miss a slight curve with my
shorter straightedge.

The planing was a lot of work.  I filled multiple trashcans and planed off
several pounds of material.

I used one beam (which had some serious checking on one end) for the legs and short stretchers,
and the other two for the top.  I roughly followed the Benchcrafted plans, but deviated from them
pretty significantly because I wasn't laminating up my components.  ["Workbenches"](https://www.amazon.com/Workbenches-Design-Construction-Popular-Woodworking/dp/1558708405)
by Christopher Schwartz was a great second reference.

Many of my components were significantly larger than the benchcrafted plans.  For example, my legs
were 5" x 6" instead of 3" x 5".  Not only did the large legs look better and add more heft, but
the internal layout was easier too.  The benchcrafted plans needed to strategically place holes to
avoid the leg vise mortise in one of the legs, which wasn't an issue for me.  I did need to reduce
my benchtop to 6'6", both due to the size of my shop and defects in the beams.  I planned the bench
to have a 10" overhang on one end and a 16" overhang on the other, in case I added a tail vise in
the future.

Before assembly my parts weighed:

* 85 lbs for legs
* 15 lbs for stretchers
* 25 lbs for rails
* 248 lbs for the tops

This 373 lbs did not include the shelf, any assembly hardware, the deadman, or the leg vise.
