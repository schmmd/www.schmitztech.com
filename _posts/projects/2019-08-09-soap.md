# Pork Soap

We made a 100% lard soap with 3-5% superfat. Calculators, SAP ratio, and lard content all vary, so we looked at multiple sources and settled on the ratio 90 oz lard to 12.05 oz lye. We wanted about 35% water relative to oil, but this measurement is less critical. We Scaled down the recipe to a 4 lb batch by lard:

* 64 oz rendered pork lard (back fat)
* 22.4 oz water
* 8.58 oz NOH (lye)

This should produce about 160 cubic inches of soap.

# Walnut Castile Soap

I had to find a use for some excess walnut oil so I made some soap.

* 90 oz walnut oil (La Tourangelle)
* 11.12 oz lye
* 0.82 oz KOH
* 30 oz water
* 1 tablespoonh salt
* 1/2 tsp walnut dye

Dissolve salt in the water and then add the lye and KOH.  One stirred and
dissolved, mix in the dye and cool to 150F.  Meanwhile heat the oil to 160F.
When both solution are at temperature add the lye to the oil and stir until
cream, homogeneous, and traced (we used a stick blender to speed up the
process).

## Notes

Next time we might use 1 tsp dye for a darker color.  The soap had a pleasant
color and fragrance, but was too soft and oily.  After a year some oil
separated out into the box we were storing the soap in.  Next time we would
certainly use a bit more lye to cut down on the excess oil.
