# Guest Bed

We wanted to build a queen guest bed and roughly followed the japanese bed
joint we used for our own bed.  The room this bed was for was more compact and
so we incorporated a headboard into the bed itself rather than having a
separate structure.

A big puzzle was how to build in a middle support since we
wanted the whole bed to be easily deconstructable (preventing us from using
mortise and tenons or bolts to connect the center support into the headboard
and footboard).  Despite using oversized 1 1/8" slats we still clearly needed a
centerboard for support.  Without one the slates bowed considerably and could
fairly easily be broken.  We ended up building a freestanding center support
with two feet.  This completely supported the slats so I could walk on it with
ease and allowed us to use a plenty wide support.  All of the weight on it goes
directly into the floor.

We screwed on a support railing for the slats to rest on, and we put in 3/8"
pegs to line up the slats.  On the underside of the slats we routed 1/2" slots
to lock over the pegs.

Below are some plans and pictures:
