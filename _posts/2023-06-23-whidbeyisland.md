Whidbey Island is the longest island in the contiguous United States.  The restriction "continental" conveniently excludes Hawaii, which is a collection of large islands, and Alaska, which is home to 16 of the 20 largest islands in the United States.  But you might ask--isn't Long Island, which has "long" in the name perhaps one of the longest islands at 118 miles?  Absolutely not!  In fact, it's not legally an island but rather an "extension of the mainland" in [United States v. Maine (1985)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/469/504/).  This leaves Isle Royale in Lake Michigan, which is larger but not longer (45 miles vs 51 miles--it helps that Whidbey is wiggly) and San Padre island off Texas which is excluded because it's very sandy.
