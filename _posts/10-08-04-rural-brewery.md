============

Warriors' Victory IPA
---------------------

* 6 lbs Golden Light Malt Syrup
* 1 lb Golden Light Dry Malt Extract
* 1/2 lb Crystal 80L
* 1/2 lb Victory Malt
* 1 Oz Warrior Hops (Boiling; 60 Minutes from Finish)
* 2 Oz Columbus Hops (Boiling; 60 Minutes from Finish)
* 1 Oz Willamette Hops (Boiling; 5 Minutes from Finish)
* 2 Oz Chinook Hops (Dry, added at time of Second Fermentation)
* Wyeast's Rogue's PACMAN Yeast

Paul and Jon Laid out the 4 different kinda of hops on a table for a smell test, and decided which hops to put in where. Other than that, no process out of the ordinary. Need to work on keeping hops from final fermenter so theres no floaties in the beer.

Original Gravity: 1.049 Final Gravity: 1.010 Approx. ABV: 5.25%

Very Floral aroma, slightly nutty malt flavor. Bitterness not overly noticed. Further tasting is going to have to be performed to really lock down flavor description. There is a lot of potential.

Turkey Stout

* 1 lb Light Powdered Malt Extract
* 1 1/4 lb Crystal 80L
* 1/2 lb Roasted Barley

* 1 Oz. WIllamete Hops (@ 60 Minutes)
