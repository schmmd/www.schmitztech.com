# Egg Nog

From Jana

Makes 40 6 oz servings.

* 2 fifths anejo rum (the anejo imparts a strong oak/vanilla flavor)
* 4 c sugar
* 24 egg yolks

Mix but don't overbeat the sugar and egg yoks.  Then add rum and refrigerate overnight.

Add 2 quarts of milk, then fold in 2 quarts of heavy whipping cream, whipped so
it is just begining to solidify.  If whipped too much, the creme won't blend
easily.

# Tom and Jerry

From Conner Jeffries

* 1 egg
* 1 c sugar
* brandy or whiskey
* hot milk
* ground nutmeg

Beat the egg and sugar until fluffy or marshmallowy

Per serving, add 2+ spoonfulls of egg mallow, 1/2 c of hot milk, and a shot of
booze.  Muddle together and top with ground nutmeg.
